# SideProjects
Dedicated myself to programming outside of my classes and grew a love to these side projects.

For town_hall_3 The main file is labeled as "index.html" while the CSS to go with the file is "main.css

There is also an alternative town hall file which is named town_hall_1 which contains the javascript allowing there to be a dropdown nav menu which is compatible to moblie.

Also the actual website should look like this.
